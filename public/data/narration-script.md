Hi! This is a quick tutorial for mapping your evacuation route. The tool helps researchers understand how people actually evacuate during emergencies.

First, you'll see the instruction screen. Choose your privacy setting once you scroll to the bottom and then Click 'Start Mapping' to begin.

Enter your starting location - where you began your evacuation. You can type an address or click directly on the map. Then enter your ending location - your final destination. The map will automatically draw the shortest route between these points.

To add stops along your route, click the 'Add Stop' button. Search for places like 'Target', 'Gas Station', or 'School' - the tool will find them and place them on your route. You can also click directly on the map to add stops. Notice how the stops are numbered in order - 1, 2, 3, and so on.

Now drag the blue route line to match the actual roads you traveled. This is important because the automatic route might not show the exact path you took. You can drag any part of the route to make it more accurate.

If you make a mistake, click 'Revert' to go back to your original route while keeping your start and end points. Use 'Clear' to start over completely. You can drag the numbered stops to reorder them if needed.

Once you are done, click 'Submit Route'. You'll get a submission ID. Copy this and paste it into Qualtrics to continue with the survey. You can submit multiple routes for different evacuation events.

Thank you for participating in this important research.
